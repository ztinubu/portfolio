		<h2>DP/VIDEOGRAPHER</h2>		

				<p>up and coming streetwear brand</p>
					
					<p>2017 - Present</p>
						
						<p>I am currently still working part-time as a videographer/DP for an up and coming streetwear brand. I create video lookbooks as well as shoot documentary footage of the production process and other endeavours. The brand still will not yet permit me to release its name, however the initials are ‘DM’.</p>

				<h2>“​MURDER IN THE SNOW”</h2>

				<p>Music video</p>
				
					<p>Freelance, 2018</p>
						
						<p>This is a music video I directed, shot, and edited for a Seattle/Los Angeles-based artist, “Roman Merlino”.</p> 

						<p>The video was filmed all around the streets of New York City. The video refers to the idea of broken relationships, break-ups, and how love develops into something much different after exiting adolescence.</p>

					 	<p>VHS- inspired, however remaining true to the clean technicality of the DSLR.</p>

				<h2>“AFTER HOURS”</h2>

				<p>Short Film</p>
					
					<p>Freelance, 2017</p>
				
						<p>I directed, filmed, and edited this piece, which is a culmination of psychogeography and my own personal interpretation on the subject with its relation to New York’s social microhabitats.​ ​</p>

						<p>Each section is set in a different area of Manhattan and represents how that area affects me visually or aesthetically.</p>

						<p>Additonally, each section depicts a small aspect of the social scene amongst young adults like me, of what it’s like to live in a intriguingly confusing visual haze.</p>

				<h2>SEATTLE GOOD BUSINESS </h2>
				
					<p>Intern, 2016-2017</p>

						<p>Interned at “SGBN” for just over three months. Their goal was to revitalize Seattle’s local manufacturing economy and reduce outsourcing, especially for entrepreneurial artists, designers, and so forth.</p>

						<p>I would create visually intriguing presentations for institutional buyers as well as sit in on meetings with manufacturers, also contacting designers about their economic footprint and how we could minimize or increase it with our services.</p>

				<h2>“DAY”</h2>

					<p>Music Video</p>
					
						<p>Freelance, 2016</p>
						
							<p>This is a music video I directed, shot, and edited for a Seattle-based artist, “I.N.O”.</p>

							<p>The music video was shot in the basement of the artist’s house with minimal equipment. The video has a dark color palette that aims to represent the elusiveness of relationships as presented in the song.</p>

				<h2>“ROSE GOLD”</h2> ​

					<p>Short Experimental-Film</p>
				
						<p>Freelance, 2016</p>

							<p>Rose Gold was a short experimental film I directed, shot, and edited. The video was created just after a friend had died, and so it was a time of great confusion. </p>

							<p>The film through its objective qualities and serenity of the camera movement are trying to depict that overwhelming confusion that comes in adolescents despite circumstance whilst also sustaining a serene quality in color scheme and the pace of the editing.</p>

				<h2>“SOUTH LAKE UNION”</h2>

					<p>Series of Portrait Photographs</p>
				
						<p>Freelance, 2016</p>
				
							<p>The dark photos highlight or obscure the visage of my subjects to present the illusive and ignored reality of Seattle.</p>
